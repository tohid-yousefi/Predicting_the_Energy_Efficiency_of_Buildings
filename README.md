# Predicting the Energy Efficiency of Buildings

📌 In this section, predicting the energy efficiency of buildings with machine learning algorithms.

<hr />

# Business Problem

📌 The dataset includes features such as surface/wall/roof area, glass area, glass area distribution and orientation of 768 simulated building shapes. Based on this data, it is aimed to estimate the heating and cooling load of the building. In this age where environmental awareness is very important, it can be a super consultancy initiative to reduce our carbon footprint, as we still haven't switched to renewable energy sources.

# Dataset Story

**Data Set Information:**

📌 We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to predict two real valued responses. It can also be used as a multi-class classification problem if the response is rounded to the nearest integer.

**Attribute Information:**

📌 The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1…X8) and two responses (or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2). The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses.

X1 Relative Compactness

X2 Surface Area

X3 Wall Area

X4 Roof Area

X5 Overall Height

X6 Orientation

X7 Glazing Area

X8 Glazing Area Distribution

y1 Heating Load

y2 Cooling Load
